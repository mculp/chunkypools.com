WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
======================

This is a hacked together project that puts a front-end that shows a dashboard for multiple running instances of MPOS, a PHP-based bitcoin / altcoin mining front-end/API.

### Why would you do that?

Because chunkypools.com allowed users to mine 10+ coins, with 3 different algorithms, at one point. MPOS is a single coin front-end.

HOW DO I DO THAT?
===============

- fork this repo
- change stuff that doesn't apply to you
- install dependencies, such as rethinkDB and rails of course
- run this like any other rails app

WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE THIS EASIER TO FORK AND CONFIGURE?
======================================================

See the fourth and fifth words of the "WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?" section. Include the fact that I haven't touched the code in a year and a half.
