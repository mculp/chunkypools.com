WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
======================

This is a hacked together dashboard for multiple instances of MPOS, a PHP-based bitcoin / altcoin mining front-end/API.

THAT SOUNDS DUMB, A FRONT-END FOR A FRONT-END?
==============================================

Yeah, but not really, because chunkypools.com allowed users to mine 10+ coins on 3 different algorithms, while MPOS is (was?) a single-coin, single-algorithm front-end.

HOW DO I DO THAT?
===============

- fork this repo
- change stuff that doesn't apply to you
- install dependencies, such as rethinkDB and rails of course
- run this like any other rails app
- oh yeah, [you're gonna need this too](https://github.com/mculp/chunky-mpos)

WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE THIS EASIER TO FORK AND CONFIGURE?
======================================================

See the fourth and fifth words of the "WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?" section. Include the fact that I haven't touched the code in a year and a half.
